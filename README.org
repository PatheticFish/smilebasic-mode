* SmileBASIC Mode
Rudimentary Emacs Major Mode for [[http://smilebasic.com/en/][SmileBASIC]]

Contributions encouraged!  I have no known plans for this file, and it has served me well in its current state for a long time, but it is still missing some features.

Possible improvements include:
- numeric highlighting
- integrating an autocomplete package like [[https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete][auto-complete.el]]
- format conversion and export to citra folders Ã  la [[http://trinitro21.github.io/]]
